# CS410p_Raycaster
Final project for my CS410p: Full Stack Web Development course.

# Overview
In this project, I set out to implement a raycast system. In brief,
Raycasting takes a top down, 2D world, and renders it as though it were
3D. It was the algorithm used to implement Wolfenstein 3D's graphics.

TODO: Finish me!
