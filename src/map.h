	Main driver for constructing a mapdef from a map_data.

	PRECONDITIONS:
	mapdef and map_data are not NULL, and the data inside map_data is valid (files
	can be found, no inappropriate values for members, etc).

	POSTCONDITIONS:
	The player position might be changed.

	ARGUMENTS:
	mapdef - the mapdef structure that will have data added to it.
	map_data - who we transform into mapdef.
	player_x and player_y and player_rot- temporary values so that we can set the player's position and rotation

	RETURNS:
	1 - Successfully built mapdef from map_data.
	0 - Failed to build mapdef from map_data.
